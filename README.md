## Hi, I'm Rodrigo 👋

### I'm DBA at [Dell Technologies](http://www.delltechnologies.com/). ✨

- 🔭 I’m currently working on database administration of SQL Server and [MongoDB](https://github.com/MongoDB).
- 💚 Passionate about building tools and automation with [PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell) in order to make the DBA life easier. ☕️ 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about containers such as Docker, Kubernetes and Pivotal Kubernetes Services (PKS).

- 😁 I created [sp_who3](https://github.com/ronascentes/sp_who3), my first open source work.
- 😐 I created a bunch of ad hoc scripts related to database administration. You can find those at my [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/ronascentes).

- 💬 You can ask me about:
  - High-availability and disaster-recovery database design
  - Performance tuning in SQL Server and MongoDB systems
