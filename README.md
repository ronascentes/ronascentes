### Hi, I'm Rodrigo 👋

I work for Dell Technologies on the Database Reliability & Enablement team. 

- I’m currently working with a set of tech such as SQL Server, MongoDB, Cassandra and Elasticsearch.
- I'm passionate about building tools and always looking to automate manual tasks to make the DBA life easier. ☕️ 

My current areas of expertise include:
- High-availability and disaster-recovery database design
- Programming languages (C#, Powershell, Bash)
- Infrastructure automation
- Monitoring and observability with Splunk, Prometheus and Grafana

My projects:
